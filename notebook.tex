    Graph project: Epidemic spreading

ENSEEIHT SN

    \subsection{Introduction}\label{introduction}

As you know, a new epidemic has overwhelmed the world, COVID-19
jeopardizes people and changes our habits. It is easy to realise that
knowing how illnesses spread is vital to our own protection. How can we
predict whether a disease will cause an epidemic, how many people it
will infect, which people it will infect, and whether or not it is
dangerous to society as a whole ? Also, how can we determine which
techniques to use in fighting an epidemic once it begins ? One way to
answer all of these questions is through mathematical modeling.

In this work you will have to review different epidemic modelings
relying all on the representation by graphs of a human network called a
contact network. A vertex in a contact network represents an individual
and an edge between two vertices represents a contact between two
individuals. The disease only spread from individual to individual if
they are in contact, so through the edges. This representation is
actually really common in research, and a lot of state-of-the-art
modeling are built over it. From these different models you will be
asked to draw conclusions from experiments on varying contact networks

For readability and ease of use, this project will be carried on a
Jupyter Notebook, hence code and question answering have to be written
in this unique file. This is a DUO project, no group of one person will
be accepted, the duo has to be composed of same TD group students, if
the number of students in the TD group is odd we will accept one group
composed of three students. It will be coded in Julia using the
LightGraphs package. BEWARE:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the code does not provide good results, its readability as well as
  its comments are essential for the corrector to potentially find some
  notation points.
\item
  The specifications of the functions have to be strictly respected.
\item
  Do not neglect written questions they stand for an important part of
  the notation, you are not only evaluated on the coding. Also, even so
  a written question may not ask you directly to code or provide results
  from code, support your arguments when possible with a runable example
  is very welcome and sometimes even expected.
\item
  Any initiatives and additional efforts bringing contents and thoughts
  out of the question scope may result in bonus points if pertinent.
\end{itemize}

Deliverable: You will deliver your work on moodle before 24.01.2021 in a
.tar containing the notebook with your codes and your written answers,
and the different graph figures in .png you will generate. The corrector
will use the student N7 computers for running your code, so take care of
verifying that your work is running as expected on these computers !

https://juliagraphs.org/LightGraphs.jl/v1.2/index.html

    \subsection{Environment and packages
installation}\label{environment-and-packages-installation}

IMPORTANT: For evaluation, coding questions have to run with no
additional packages ! Only the ones present here ! However if you want
to use another package to go further in your answer and add bonus
contents, take care of separating the cells and precising which packages
you are using.

    \subsection{Part 1 - SIS model}\label{part-1---sis-model}

SIS is a compartmental model, ie a model where the population is divided
into subgroups that represent the disease status of its members. SIS
stands for Susceptible \(\rightarrow\) Infected \(\rightarrow\)
Susceptible where the susceptible group contains those who remain
susceptible to the infection, and the infected group consists of those
who not only have the disease but are also in the contagious period of
the disease.

Combine with a contact network approach, this model can capture contact
patterns (family, company, friends). Each vertex represents an
individual in the host population, and contacts between two individuals
are represented by an edge that connects the two. The probability of
transmitting the disease from an infected to a susceptible individual
along one of these edges or contacts is \(\beta\) (=infection rate). The
probability to cure is \(\alpha\) (= curing rate).

In order for a disease to begin spreading through a network, the disease
must be introduced into the population, either through infecting a
proportion of the population or through infecting one individual. As
time moves forward, the disease will spread away from those initially
infected, and two things may occur simultaneously at each time step
\(t\). First, each infected individual will spread disease to each of
its contacts with a probability \(\beta\). Secondly, each infectious
individual will recover at a rate, \(\alpha\) , at which point the
individual will then no longer infect any of its contacts. After the
disease has run its course, we can determine how the disease affected
the network by calculating various quantities that help us better

    \subsubsection{1.2 Introduce the
infection}\label{introduce-the-infection}

We denote by state a vector containing the disease status of each vertex
where Susceptible=0 and Infected=1. Then state is an Array\{Int32,1\} of
length the number of vertices. This array in addition of a graph
(represented internally by an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list)
will be the data structure of our model.

{In Array\{Int32,1\}, Int32 refers to the kind of data in the array,
here 32 bits integers, 1 refers to the dimension of the array, here we
have a 1-dimensional structure so a vector.}

    Question 1 (code): For each graph in the graph sample (karat7, n7\_2A,
toulouse\_neigh) initialize the state array by assigning each vertex to
susceptible and add randomly one or numerous infected people. Save the
graph as a .png image using gplot and draw, infected should appear in a
different color (colorant"orange").

Due to a bug on certain version of Jupyter Notebook, the graph {figures
should be saved in a file and not plot inside the notebook } !!!

    Question 2 (written): What do you think/predict about the influence of
the initial number of infected people and their locations on the
evolution of an SIS model epidemic ?

Answer:

    \section{TODO}\label{todo}

    \subsubsection{1.3 Spread the infection}\label{spread-the-infection}

    Question 3 (code): Implement the function SIS (respect the header and
the specifications). You can use rand to translate the probabilities.
Test your algorithm on karat7, n7\_2A, and toulouse\_neigh with
arbitrary \(\beta\), \(\alpha\), and \(t\).

{The corrector should be able to write new\_state =
SIS(net,state,beta,alpha,t) with your code.}

    \subsubsection{1.4 Simulate and understand the
epidemic}\label{simulate-and-understand-the-epidemic}

In the SIS model of this project, every disease is characterized by:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The infection rate \(\beta\) representing the chance of infection when
  being in contact with an infected individual.
\item
  The curing rate \(\alpha\) representing the chance of being cured of
  the disease.
\item
  The effective spreading rate \(\tau=\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\)
  representing the capacity of the disease to spread. More the disease
  infect easily (\(\beta\) high) and less it is cured easily (\(\alpha\)
  low) more \(\tau\) can be high.
\end{itemize}

We are now willing to understand what are the influences of these
parameters as well as the contact network shape on an epidemic.

    Question 4 (written): The function SIS you implemented launches one run
of an SIS model on a given contact network. As it makes use of
randomness, one run of spreading is stochastic. Then what simple
estimator/method can you propose to provide a prediction of the disease
spreading on a given contact network ?

Answer:

    La moyenne empirique est un estimateur convergent de l'espérance d'une
variable aléatoire.

\(\theta_{n} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n X_i\)

    Question 5 (code): Implement the function Simulation\_SIS (respect the
header and the specifications).

{The corrector should be able to write predictions, taus =
Simulation\_SIS(net,nbinf,betas,alphas,t,nbsimu) with your code.}

    Question 8 (code): Implement a script plotting the maximum percentage of
infected people according to \(\tau\) over 300 time steps for 3 contact
networks:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A regular graph of 200 vertices with degree 2.
\item
  A regular graph of 200 vertices with degree 5.
\item
  A regular graph of 200 vertices with degree 10.
\end{itemize}

You can use the function random\_regular\_graph(n,d) of LighGraphs. As
you probably need to use a certain number of different values of
\(\tau\) to visualize something interesting (the more there are the more
the figure will be smooth) you should fix \(\alpha\) and make \(\beta\)
vary.

{A regular graph is a graph where each vertex has the same degree.}

    Question 9 (written): Describe the figure and draw conclusions on the
epidemic behavior for different degrees \(d\) on regular graphs. Thus,
in addition of the inner properties of the disease (\(\alpha\),
\(\beta\), \(\tau\)) what other parameter is essential in the spreading
? Finally, what analogy can be done with real life from this experiment
?

Answer:

    \subsection{Part 2 - SIR and SAIR
model}\label{part-2---sir-and-sair-model}

Unfortunately SIS model is valuable for diseases we can catch back since
a cured person can get ill again. This is true for the flu, the cold,
etc. However COVID-19 might create immunity for whom already got it and
SIS can not take into account immune or dead persons. That is why we
propose in this part to consider another model more adapted to COVID-19
called SIR. It stands for Susceptible \(\rightarrow\) Infected
\(\rightarrow\) Recovered where the susceptible group contains those who
remain susceptible to the infection, the infected group consists of
those who not only have the disease but are also in the contagious
period of the disease, and the recovered group contains those who were
ill, got cured, are not contagious and can not get ill anymore.

M. Youssef and C. Scoglio, "An individual-based approach to SIR
epidemics in contact networks", Journal of Theoretical Biology 283
(2011)

One limitation of SIR is that it does not model the reaction of humans
when they feel the presence of the epidemic. Indeed, if feeling threaten
or surrounded by infected, an individual may change its behaviors: wear
mask, wash its hands, etc. This result in a smaller infection rate. That
is why in this part we will also consider a variant of SIR called SAIR
which stands for Susceptible \(\rightarrow\) Alert \(\rightarrow\)
Infected \(\rightarrow\) Recovered. A susceptible individual becomes
infected by the infection rate \(\beta_0\), an infected individual
recovers and gets immune by the curing rate \(\alpha\), an individual
can observe the states of its neighbors, then a susceptible individual
might go to the alert state if surrounded by infected individuals with
an alert rate \(\kappa\) on each contact with an infected, an alert
inividual becomes infected by the infection rate \(\beta_1\) where
\(0<\beta_1<\beta_0\). In our simple SAIR model, an individual can not
go back to a susceptible state when he got into the alert state.

F. Darabi Sahneh and C. Scoglio, "Epidemic Spread in Human Networks",
50th IEEE Conf. Decision and Contol, Orlando, Florida (2011)

    \subsubsection{2.1 SIR}\label{sir}

The vector containing the disease status state has to change a bit since
we added a new state. Hence it will be an Array\{Int32,1\} where
Susceptible=0, Infected=1, and Recovered=2.

    Question 10 (code): Implement the function SIR (respect the header and
the specifications). You can use rand to translate the probabilities.
Test your algorithm on karat7, n7\_2A, and toulouse\_neigh with
arbitrary \(\beta\), \(\alpha\), and \(t\). Recovered vertices should
appear in a different color (colorant"purple").

{The corrector should be able to write new\_state =
SIR(net,state,beta,alpha,t) with your code.}

    Question 15 (written): From the previous figure, explain why lockdown
can be interesting when hospital places are lacking ?

Answer:

    \subsubsection{2.2 SAIR}\label{sair}

The vector containing the disease status state has to change a bit since
we added a new state. Hence it will be an Array\{Int32,1\} where
Susceptible=0, Infected=1, Recovered=2, and Alert=3.

    Question 16 (code): Implement the function SAIR (respect the header and
the specifications). You can use rand to translate the probabilities.
Test your algorithm on karat7, n7\_2A, and toulouse\_neigh with
arbitrary \(\beta\), \(\alpha\), and \(t\). Alerted vertices should
appear in a different color (colorant"lightgreen").

{The corrector should be able to write new\_state =
SAIR(net,state,beta0,beta1,alpha,kappa,t) with your code.}

    Question 19 (written): Of course the presented SIS, SIR, and SAIR models
are limitated in their modelization of the reality. Formulate few of
these limitations (at least 2). Propose few algorithm addons/ideas (at
least 2) which would make the models more complex and more accurate in
regards to the reality.

Answer:

    \subsection{Part 3 - Discover patient
zero}\label{part-3---discover-patient-zero}

In the two previous parts you may have realised that understanding and
controlling the spread of epidemics on contact networks is an important
task. However, information about the origin of the epidemic could be
also extremely useful to reduce or prevent future outbreaks. Thus, in
this part we will focus on algorithm solutions to answer this issue.

The stochastic nature of infection propagation makes the estimation of
the epidemic origin intrinsically hard: indeed, different initial
conditions can lead to the same configuration at the observation time.
Methods such as the distance centrality or the Jordan center try to
approximate it. They both rely on spatial information by stating that
the first infected is probably at the center of the cluster of
infection. Mathematically:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The jordan center is expressed as
  \(\min_{v\in \mathcal{I}}\max_{n\in \mathcal{I}}d(v,n)\) where
  \(\mathcal{I}\) is a connected component of the original contact
  network containing all infected and recovered vertices, and where
  \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the distance (= the shortest path) between 2
  vertices (if not weighted graph each edge accounts for 1 unit).
\item
  The distance centrality is expressed as
  \(\min_{v\in \mathcal{I}}\sum_{n\in \mathcal{I}}d(v,n)(\delta_{n,I} + \delta_{n,R}/\alpha)\),
  where \(\delta_{n,I}=1\) if the vertex n is infected (\(=0\)
  otherwise), and where \(\delta_{n,R}=1\) if the vertex n is recovered
  (\(=0\) otherwise). You may note that in distance centrality we
  increase the weight of the recovered vertices by a factor
  \(1/\alpha\), it translates the fact that recovered vertices tend to
  be closer to the origin of the epidemic since they probably got ill
  before.
\end{itemize}

We formulate the problem as follow: given a contact network and a
snapshot of epidemic spread at a certain time, determine the infection
source. A snapshot is a given state array for a contact network.

    Question 20 (code): Implement the function jordan (respect the header
and the specifications). You will need to use the function
dijkstra\_shortest\_paths of the LighGraphs library, refer to the doc
for more information. If there are multiple minimal vertices, then
return the first one.
